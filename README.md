# DnDTAFight
Have you ever wanted to fight your professor but were too scrawny to do so yourself? 
Well now you can generate a random DND Monster with their face on it, and take out all your coding frustration on them!
This app makes an api call to an open source dnd monster repository, and then finds a suitable picture through the google image api,
Which it then slaps the face of your TAs. Defeat all four TAs and you face your professor.
