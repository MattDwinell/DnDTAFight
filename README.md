# DnDTAFight
Have you ever wanted to fight your professor but were too scrawny to do so yourself? 
Well now you can generate a random DND Monster with their face on it, and take out all your coding frustration on them!
This app makes an api call to an open source dnd monster repository, and then finds a suitable picture through the google image api,
Which it then slaps the face of your TA on top of. If you can't picture what we're talking about, just look below. Defeat all four TAs and you get to  face your professor. If you Defeat enough enemies in a row, or if the enemy monster defeats you enough, the character will become immortalized, able to be viewed by all future players of the app (i.e. saved within a firebase database)
notable components: Firebase, ajax, Materialize css, user sign in, (basic)animations
